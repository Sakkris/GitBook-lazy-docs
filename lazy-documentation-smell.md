# Lazy Documentation Smell

## Defining Lazy Documentation

Documentation is categorised as ‘Lazy’ if it lacks the necessary information to convey to the readers. In many cases, it is seen that the documentation does not contain any extra information except what can be perceived directly from the function name. Hence, this kind of documentation does not have much to offer to the readers. [\[1\]](lazy-documentation-smell.md#references)&#x20;

## The Potential of Large Language Models and Generative AI tools

### Potential for Detecting Lazy Documentation



### Potential for Correcting Lazy Documentation
