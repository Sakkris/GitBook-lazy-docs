# Introduction

In theory, good documentation is an invaluable asset to any software project as it helps developers use, understand, maintain, and evolve a system. In the case of APIs it is even more valuable, as in a lot of cases, the developers that are going to use it, aren't the ones that developed it in the first place, so it is completely unknown to them.&#x20;

However, in practice, documentation is often affected by numerous shortcomings and issues such as insufficient and inadequate content, as well as obsolete and ambiguous information. It is, most of the time, seen as a "post-development issue", an afterthought for the developers, which is what leads to these issues.

## The Documentation Smells

When looking at the documentation smells that might exist when analysing API documentation, 5 main smells can be considered [\[1\]](references.md):&#x20;

1. Bloated Documentation Smell.&#x20;
2. Excess Structural Information Smell.
3. Tangled Documentation Smell.&#x20;
4. Fragmented Documentation Smell.&#x20;
5. Lazy Documentation Smell.

The documentation that this paper will focus on, is the "Lazy Documentation Smell", which is both the most problematic and most prevalent smell in most API documentation [\[1\]](references.md). This is the issue that better showcases the way developers look at documentation as simply an afterthought, as it refers to the lack of effort placed into creating said documentation.
