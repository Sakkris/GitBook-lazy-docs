# Why it is problematic

Lazy documentation, as mentioned in the previous page, ["Defining Lazy Documentation"](defining-lazy-documentation.md), is the most problematic of the five smells defined by [Junaed Younus Khan](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088507069), [Md. Tawkat Islam Khondaker](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088863088), [Gias Uddin](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38234973300) and [Anindya Iqbal](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37653240200) [\[1\]](references.md).&#x20;

The problem that appears with this smell, is, as its definition implies, the lack of required information. While some endpoints or resources in an API can be self-explanatory and don't require a detailed description, in most cases, this is not what happens. The lack of information on how to use the API can leave developers puzzled in how they can use the API, and sometimes it might even lead to developers completely giving up on using the API [\[1\]](references.md), forcing them to look for other solutions.

All developers, have faced or eventually will face this issue while trying to use certain API, or even software in general. The documentation tends to be looked at as a "post-development issue", leading to developers not placing much care into it and being lazy, ending up writing documentation just for the sake of saying that they created the documentation, dooming other developers who might want or even need to use their API.&#x20;
